# Development Containers Website

This repo holds the website for the [Development Containers Specification](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec).

You may view the site at [devcontainers.github.io](https://devcontainers.github.io/containers.dev/).

## Building

If you'd like to build and preview the site yourself, we make it as smooth as possible through a dev container in this repo!

* Clone or open this repo in the dev container-supporting editor of your choosing. You may review supporting tools and services [here](https://devcontainers.github.io/containers.dev/supporting).
* Reopen this repo in the dev container. You may review its contents in the [`.devcontainer`](https://github.com/devcontainers/containers.dev/tree/gh-pages/.devcontainer) folder.
* Once the dev container finishes building, start the site: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
* Visit the site: http://localhost:4000/containers.dev/
